# Internxt CLI with rclone

This repository contains a Docker setup to run the Internxt CLI with rclone support. It allows you to synchronize files between your local filesystem and Internxt using WebDAV.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be set when running the Docker container. You can define up to 20 pairs of remote and local paths. Note that for each local path, a corresponding remote path is necessary.

| Environment Variable                   | Description                                                                                  |

## Docker Image

The Docker image is available on Docker Hub under the name `cgfm/internxt-cli_rclone`.

## Running the Container

### Docker Run Command

You can run the Docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -e INTERNXT_EMAIL="your_email@example.com" \
           -e INTERNXT_PASSWORD="your_password" \
           -e CRON_SCHEDULE="*/15 * * * *" \
           -e REMOTE_PATH_1="remote:path1" \
           -e LOCAL_PATH_1="/local/path1" \
           -e PUID=1000 \
           -e PGID=1000 \
           -e TZ="America/New_York" \
           -p 3005:3005 \
           -p 5572:5572 \
           --rm cgfm/internxt-cli_rclone
```

### Docker Compose Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use Docker Compose to run the container:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  internxt-cli:
    container_name: internxt-cli_rclone 
    image: cgfm/internxt-cli_rclone
    environment:
      INTERNXT_EMAIL: your_email@example.com
      INTERNXT_PASSWORD: your_password
      CRON_SCHEDULE: '*/15 * * * *'
      REMOTE_PATH_1: remote:path1
      LOCAL_PATH_1: /local/path1
      PUID: 1000
      PGID: 1000
      TZ: "America/New_York"
    ports:
      - "3005:3005"
      - "5572:5572"
    volumes:
      - /local/config/dir:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Building and Executing Cron Commands

The `CRON_COMMAND` environment variable allows you to specify a custom command that will be executed by cron based on the defined schedule. If no command is provided, the default command used is:

```
rclone sync --create-empty-src-dirs --retries 5 --differ --verbose
```

The cron command will be built to include all pairs of local and remote paths defined. For example, if you define `LOCAL_PATH_1` and `REMOTE_PATH_1`, the command will be constructed to run the sync between these two paths.

## Health Check

The health check for the container ensures that:
- The Internxt service is running.
- The rclone Web GUI is accessible.
- The cron service is running and, if a cron schedule is defined, that the specified cron job is set correctly.

If `CRON_SCHEDULE` is not defined (i.e., it is empty), the health check will skip checking the cron service and job presence, allowing the container to remain healthy if the other checks pass.

If any of the checks related to the Internxt service or rclone Web GUI fail, the container will be marked as unhealthy.
